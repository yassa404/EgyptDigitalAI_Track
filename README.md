# Egypt Digital Initiative - AI & Data Science Track

This repository contains projects and notes from the **AI & Data Science Track** under the **Digital Egypt Initiative**. This course, powered by Microsoft, covers topics in AI and data science, including Data Science with Python, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), MLOps, and Azure AI tools.

## Repository Structure

- **Prompt Engineering**  
  Exercises and projects focused on prompt creation for AI models.

- **Statistics and Linear Algebra Basics**  
  Core mathematical concepts used in data science.

- **Data Science with Python**  
  Projects and data analysis scripts in Python.

- **Introduction to Machine Learning**  
  Basic machine learning models and applications.

- **Azure AI Fundamentals**  
  Labs and notes on Microsoft Azure AI tools.

- **NLP with Attention Models**  
  Projects on NLP techniques, including attention models.

- **GANs**  
  Basic projects on Generative Adversarial Networks.

- **MLOps, MLflow, and Hugging Face**  
  Projects on MLOps tools for tracking and deploying models.

- **Capstone Project**  
  A final project applying skills from the entire course.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.9**
- Required libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `tensorflow`/`pytorch`, `mlflow`, `huggingface`.
- **Microsoft Azure account** for Azure-related labs.
